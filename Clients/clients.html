            <p class="textcolor2">The legacy of the water that gave life to an entire region and made a small city grow
                into a metropolis for several years was lost. It was a long and beautiful journey to bring it back.

                Selita Water is back.

                Three years ago, Blu-Imperial and Kastrati Group decided to bring back Selita Water from its well-known
                fountain in Qafë Mollë village at the Dajti Mountain. An ancient, fresh, and mineral-enriched water,
                sourcing from a wild spring, 1000 m above sea level. The client needed to restore the brand image,
                damaged by unauthorized sellers who used to deliver water from the same fountain in the suburbs of
                Tirana and in poor conditions.

                Smile took it as a noble task, to build the new brand identity of a legendary water. Thanks to our
                expertise in packaging and industrial design, we crafted a whole line of Selita bottles which took
                inspiration from the traditional costumes of women living in Tirana Highlands. To honor the brand
                legacy, its logo and the pattern of the label is designed to resemble the composition of the dress worn
                by the girls who were in charge to collect the water in the fountain.

                In full force, with all its beauty, with all its values.

                The long journey to bring back Selita Water and its unique mineral values was marked with a dedicated
                slogan: All values of nature. The launching campaign of the new brand was developed 360°, with a TVC,
                OOH, radio, and a digital marketing campaign on Google and social networks.

            <p>It took us three long years to make it to the market! Honestly, If I had the chance to get back in time,
                I would not change a single thing. The guys are friendly, creative, and at the same time very
                professional. I felt very comfortable and part of every process. This is priceless. VATRA gifted us with
                a unique brand identity, which matched our legacy and had a superb response! Full respect!

<h1><p class="textcolor4">COME TO YOUR BANK!<p></h1>
<h4><p class="textcolor5">One of the most valuable partners of Smile Agency is the prestigious banking institution Credins Bank. Thanks to Smile's creative and strategic work, the marketing campaigns for Credins Bank not only provide relevant information, but also the necessary reliability to trust the conveyed messages. Based on the services, the marketing campaigns are well-thought of and diverse.

    Credins Bank created the business services package to assist small and mid-sized enterprises. Therefore we carried out a marketing campaign composed of an advertising spot, an outdoor and indoor campaign which was also extended to social media.
    
    The advertising spot is dynamic and designed as a pleasant confrontation of representatives of small and mid-sized enterprises in Credins Bank. Every detail of the spot conveys gratitude and positive energy, whilst discussing the experience with the business-dedicated package.
    
    The spirit of the entire campaign carried out by Vatra Agency to promote the business package in all communication channels is a message of trust and security.

<h4><p class="textcolor7">Noval Laboratories is a modern and professional laboratory that performs specific quality tests in the field of pharmaceuticals, environment, and food safety in Albania. Also, the laboratory conducts in-depth studies and researches.

    Smile Agency worked on the visual representation of the vision of Noval Laboratories; the vision of security, accuracy, professionalism and reliability. The work of Noval Laboratories provides results because it is based on science. The creation of the visual identity of this laboratory was an interesting process for the creative staff at Smile. After studying the tools and methods used, the symbol we chose for the logo was the petri dish, representing the work in the laboratory.  It is meticulously thought out in detail expressing the variety of elements used in tests. Even though we used several colors for the logo, it conveys a clean and accurate image.
    
    The logo fits in well both visually and conceptually with all the other elements of the identity package designed by Smile Agency.

<h4><p class="textcolor9">It’s good for your company health

    The health advertising industry has a key role in our society because it has the potential to promote the best products and medical innovations. This time our goal was to generate highly engaged and healthy conscious consumers.
    
    “They need to understand the importance of what we do”
    
    ApialPharma is one of the main pharmaceutical distributors in the country. The company supports more than 2000 pharmacies and 50 (non)public hospitals with generic prescription medicines, OTC, food supplements, and medical devices. Still, it was concerned about the fact that the final consumer couldn’t sense the full importance of their everyday operations.
    
    Vatra Agency took the challenge by proposing and delivering a combined strategy, a mix of content solutions crafted for traditional and new media channels. The company brand and several products were promoted through an extensive PR campaign on TV and a digital strategy expanded on different social media platforms.
    
    Finally, thousands of consumers could witness the company proportions and its direct role in their well-being.
    
    Craft for a better life
    
    Our designers, social media managers, and video production team made a series of photo shootings and crafted different videos about the company’s main products. Our creative approach aimed not just to promote the products “in great style”. We chose to communicate the benefits and the harmony of choosing a reliant partner as ApialPharma.

<h1><p class="textcolor10">BRINGING GOOD MOOD THROUGH TELEVIZION </p></h1>
<h4><p class="textcolor11">Klanifornia is an Albanian comedy show created by Turjan Hyska, produced by Alexander Frangaj and presented by renowned Albanian host Marina Vjollca. The brand new format developed by TV Klan will be one of the main shows by this TV Channel, a format that will be broadcast every Saturday or Sunday in prime time.TV Klan’s executives and program creators approached Vatra Agency to create a visual identity of the show. It would need to represent elements of the American entertainment industry, intertwined with Albanian reality and the context of its target audience. In addition, we had to create a title sequence in 3D motion graphics for the show’s opening and closure. The Design Department at Vatra Agency managed to create an identity in line with the client’s expectations. Immediately after the creation of the visual identity, inspired by the elements set out in the brief, our video &animation team created a series of graphic elements that were implemented through 3D animation techniques in time for the broadcast date of its premiere to the public.

<h1><p class="textcolor12">TOGETHER WE STAND</p></h1>
<h4><p class="textcolor13">If you are leading in several markets with dozens of different products is not a mere coincidence to find yourself confused about your core identity. At some point, your clients must know that you are the one behind a series of successful operations.

    We grew to become a group.
    
    Founded in 1996, as a modest shop for trading tiles and sanitary equipment, in less than 15 years DELTA grew to become one of the leading companies in Albania. Nowadays, Delta has international proportions and owns different market-leading companies, with branches all over Europe, like Delta, Dast, Deutchcolor, Delta Home, Thermo Swiss, and DC Industries. We at Vatra Agency were appointed to do what we do best: to craft a strong brand that could finally unite all the Delta companies under a common umbrella. Vatra Agency developed the first visual identity of Delta Group.
    
    Something distinctive to keep us tight.
    
    The group logo was designed to resemble its core values by embodying at the same time a strong connection with the company identity. The brandmark is shaped from the name initials “D” and “G” that intertwine in a strong knot that symbolically connects all the group companies and assets. The two letters embrace each other to form a union, a group of companies that stand for each other.
    
    To visually enhance the promotional materials and to design memorable signs, the company’s visual identity was enriched by a series of graphic elements.
